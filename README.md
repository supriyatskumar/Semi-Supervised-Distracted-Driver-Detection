# Semi-Supervised-Distracted-Driver-Detection

## Problem Statement
Distracted driving is defined as any activity that takes away your attention from driving whether it be talking on a cell phone, texting, operating a radio, eating, or talking to a passenger. In 2018, there were 2841 deaths and around 400,000 people in the United States injured as a result of crashes involving distracted drivers. [1]

This project is to recognize and correctly classify different forms of distracted driving using 2D dashboard images to minimize car accidents.
